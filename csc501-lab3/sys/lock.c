/**
 * In your implementation, no readers should be kept waiting unless 
 * (i) a writer has already obtained the lock, or 
 * (ii) there is a higher priority writer already waiting for the lock. 
 * 
 * ----------------- below is for releaseall.c -------------------------
 * Hence, when a writer or the last reader releases a lock, the lock 
 * should be next given to a process having the highest waiting priority 
 * for the lock. In the case of equal waiting priorities, the lock will 
 * be given to the process that has the longest waiting time 
 * (in milliseconds) on the lock. 
 * 
 * If the waiting priorities are equal and the waiting time difference 
 * is within 1 second, writers should be given preference to acquire 
 * the lock over readers. 
 * 
 * In any case, if a reader is chosen to have a lock, then 
 * all the other waiting readers having priority not less than 
 * that of the highest-priority waiting writer for the same lock 
 * should also be admitted.

/**
Control is returned only when the process is able to acquire the lock. 
Otherwise, the calling process is blocked until the lock can be obtained.

Acquiring a lock has the following meaning:
1. The lock is free, i.e., no process is owning it. 
	In this case the process that requested the lock gets the lock 
	and sets the type of locking as READ or WRITE.

2. Lock is already acquired:
	a. For READ:
		If the requesting process has specified the lock type as READ 
		and has sufficiently high priority (not less than the highest 
		priority writer process waiting for the lock), it acquires 
		the lock, else not.
	b. For WRITE:
		In this case, the requesting process does not get the lock 
		as WRITE locks are exclusive.
